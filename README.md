# Dara Board Game Web Application

This project was created as part of the 'Tecnologias Web' course by the students [André Sousa](https://github.com/anfisou), 
[António Cardoso](https://github.com/ToniCardosooo) and [Tomás Monteiro](https://github.com/Trucak).

## Project Objective

The primary aim of this project was to develop a dynamic web application enabling multiple players to engage in the strategic board game 'Dara' over the internet.

## Implementation Details

Our team focused on crafting the client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interface displays the current state of the board and facilitates gameplay, including an option for offline play against an AI opponent.

For the server-side implementation, we utilized JavaScript with Node.js.

## Usage Instructions

To experience the application firsthand, follow these simple steps:

1. Host the server using `node server/index.js`.
2. Open the `client/index.html` file in your web browser (multiple instances for multiple players if desired).

Enjoy your game of Dara!
